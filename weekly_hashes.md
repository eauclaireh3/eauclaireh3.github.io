# WEEKLY HASHES

## HOW DO I HASH?
Just show up ready to run (or walk, or just hang out) at the weekly bar.  We hash rain or sun, sleet or snow, hot or cold. Most hashers arrive between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. in time to have a pint or two before hashing at 6:00 p.m. If you are coming for the first time, and insist on being five minutes early, donâ€™t worry, someone will likely be there eventually. If you don't feel like running, we offer a new walking group and often a few of us stay behind to continue enjoying our specials at the watering hole or play games.
